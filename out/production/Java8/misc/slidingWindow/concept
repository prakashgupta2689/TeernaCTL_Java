ex: arr= {2, 3, 5, 4, 7, 9, 1}
and subarray size is given -- a subarray is a contiguous elements of array
problem kya hai?
-- 3 size ka subarray nikalna hai and unn sab subarray mein se jiska bhi sum maximum hai woh batana hai

1. write the brute force soln
2. identify the repetitive work
ex: if you use 2 for loops to calculate the sum of all subarrays ->
2, 3, 5, 4, 7, 9, 1 --> first subarray of size 3 -> 2, 3, 5 => x
2nd subarray of size 3 --> with i incremented by 1 and j running from i to 3 => 3, 5, 2 = y

if you observe carefully, x has elements 2, 3, 5 and y has elements 3, 5, 4 => that means the
sum of 3, 5 is repeated. Hence, we can optimize this.
To get y from x we can subtract 2 and add 4. Hence, you got this result using the previous step result.

toh humlog kya karenge har baar ek ko ghatayenge and ek ko badhayenge. Issey kya hoga?
humlog repetitive work nhi kar rhe.
iss ghatane and badhane ko with the help of i and j ko sliding window kehte hai

How to identify problems involving sliding window?
- given string or array
- asked something about subarray or substring
- window size -> if not given you need to find out

two types of sliding window ?
- fixed sliding window
- variable sliding window => window size will not be given but can be asked in question
=> asked to find largest window or smallest window

Problems:
- Fixed:
    - Max/Min sub array sum of size K
    - 1st negative in every window of size K
    - count occurances of anagrams
    - Maximum of all subarrays of size K

- Variable
    - Largest/Smallest subarray of sum K
    - Largest substring with K distinct characters
    - Length of largest substring with or without repeating characters
    - Pick Toy
    - minimum window substring
