/**
 * Given an array(0-based indexing), you have to find the max sum of i*misc.A[i] where misc.A[i] is the element at index i in the array.
 * The only operation allowed is to rotate(clock-wise or counter clock-wise) the array any number of times.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input:
 * N = 4
 * misc.A[] = {8,3,1,2}
 * Output: 29
 * Explanation: Above the configuration
 * possible by rotating elements are
 * 3 1 2 8 here sum is 3*0+1*1+2*2+8*3 = 29
 * 1 2 8 3 here sum is 1*0+2*1+8*2+3*3 = 27
 * 2 8 3 1 here sum is 2*0+8*1+3*2+1*3 = 17
 * 8 3 1 2 here sum is 8*0+
