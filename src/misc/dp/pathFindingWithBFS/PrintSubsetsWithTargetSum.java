 * 1. You are given a number n, representing the count of elements.
 * 2. You are given n numbers.
 * 3. You are given a number "tar".
 * 4. You are required to calculate and print true or false, if there is a subset the elements of which add up to "tar" or not.
 * 5. Also, you have to print the indices of elements that should be selected to achieve the given target.
 * 6. You have to print all such configurations.
 *
 * 1. First create the dp array same as the target sum subset problem
 * 2. start from the end of the dp array, do the reverse engineering and see if usko leke ya usko hata ke yes hai ya nhi. Go recursively up.
